You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls\n provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some\n cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database\n available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination\n product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration,",
